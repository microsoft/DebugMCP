# Changelog

All notable changes to DebugMCP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`get_unbound_breakpoints` tool** — returns all breakpoints that the debugger could not bind to an executable line (`verified === false` in the DAP protocol). Useful for diagnosing silent `add_breakpoint` failures. Reports the debugger’s own reason string when available. Without an active debug session all pending breakpoints are listed with a reminder to call `start_debugging` first.
- **`add_breakpoint` now reports verification status** — after setting a breakpoint the tool waits briefly and queries the active debug session via `getDebugProtocolBreakpoint`. The response is now a JSON object with `file`, `line`, `verified`, and an optional `hint` explaining why the breakpoint could not be bound. Addresses the silent-failure issue described in [#18](https://github.com/microsoft/DebugMCP/issues/18).

## [1.0.8] - 2025-03-14

### Added
- Improved debug state reporting with richer context for AI agents
- Named debug configuration support via `configurationName` parameter — use specific `launch.json` configurations by name

### Fixed
- Fixed debug state consistency issues during rapid step operations

## [1.0.7] - 2025-02-XX

### Changed
- **Migrated from SSE to Streamable HTTP transport** — faster, more reliable MCP communication
- Automatic migration of existing SSE configurations to new Streamable HTTP format
- SSE backward compatibility maintained during transition period

### Fixed
- Dependency security updates (undici, express, body-parser, glob, js-yaml)

### Internal
- Migrated from `fastmcp` to official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`

## [1.0.6] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Agent auto-configuration popup** — automatically detects and registers with AI assistants (Cline, Copilot, Cursor)
- **Comprehensive documentation** — added architecture docs, AGENTS.md, and troubleshooting guides
- Language-specific debugging tips for Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, and Go

### Fixed
- Fixed failure when `launch.json` contains comments (JSONC parsing)
- Fixed C++ debug configuration issues
- Fixed string equality comparison in breakpoint matching

## [1.0.5] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Debug specific test methods** — pass `testName` to debug individual unit tests
- Clear all breakpoints tool for quick cleanup
- Breakpoint listing tool to view all active breakpoints

### Changed
