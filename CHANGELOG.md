# Changelog

All notable changes to DebugMCP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`get_loaded_scripts` tool** — returns all scripts currently loaded in the active debug session via the DAP `loadedSources` request. Works on a running session without requiring execution to be paused. Each entry contains `name`, `path` (null for dynamically generated scripts), and `sourceReference` (non-zero when there is no on-disk path). Gracefully returns an error object if there is no active session or if the debug adapter does not support `loadedSources`.

## [1.0.8] - 2025-03-14

### Added
- Improved debug state reporting with richer context for AI agents
- Named debug configuration support via `configurationName` parameter — use specific `launch.json` configurations by name

### Fixed
- Fixed debug state consistency issues during rapid step operations

## [1.0.7] - 2025-02-XX

### Changed
- **Migrated from SSE to Streamable HTTP transport** — faster, more reliable MCP communication
- Automatic migration of existing SSE configurations to new Streamable HTTP format
- SSE backward compatibility maintained during transition period

### Fixed
- Dependency security updates (undici, express, body-parser, glob, js-yaml)

### Internal
- Migrated from `fastmcp` to official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`

## [1.0.6] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Agent auto-configuration popup** — automatically detects and registers with AI assistants (Cline, Copilot, Cursor)
- **Comprehensive documentation** — added architecture docs, AGENTS.md, and troubleshooting guides
- Language-specific debugging tips for Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, and Go

### Fixed
- Fixed failure when `launch.json` contains comments (JSONC parsing)
- Fixed C++ debug configuration issues
- Fixed string equality comparison in breakpoint matching

## [1.0.5] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Debug specific test methods** — pass `testName` to debug individual unit tests
- Clear all breakpoints tool for quick cleanup
- Breakpoint listing tool to view all active breakpoints

### Changed

- Step-through execution (step over, step into, step out)
- Variable inspection with scope filtering (local, global, all)
- Expression evaluation in debug context
- Automatic debug configuration generation from file extensions
- MCP server with SSE transport

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- Initial release
- Core debugging capabilities via MCP protocol
- VS Code Debug Adapter Protocol integration
